We will walk you through all the code so if you are not familiar with python you can simply click through the code boxes (see \"How to run this exercise\" below). If you are familiar with python and machine learning, there is a stretch exercise at the end of the notebook.\n\nThe aim of this example is to predict the geopotential at the 500hPa pressure level in the atmosphere and compare your solution with the benchmark dataset. This variable is important for identifying weather systems such as cyclones and anticyclones.\n\nWith the data you will download, you can make a forecast for any number of days ahead, but in this exercise we focus on forecasting the geopotential five days ahead.\n\nWe evaluate our model using the Root Mean Squared Error.","metadata":{"id":"usMyjJA8-p7r"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How to run this exercise\n\nThis exercise is in the form of a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

Follow the instructions below to connect to a GPU. After that you can run each block of code by selecting shift+control repeatedly, or by selecting the \"play\" icon. \n\nAdvanced users may wish to run this exercise on their own computers by first installing Python and Jupyter, in addition to the packages listed below (xarray, numpy and tensorflow), or as listed in the \"environment.yml\" file in https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate/tree/main/tier_1.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<style>\ntd, th {\n   border: 1px solid white;\n   border-collapse: collapse;\n}\n</style>\n<table align=\"left\">\n  <tr>\n    <th>Run the tutorial via free cloud platforms: </th>\n    <th><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate/blob/main/tier_1/weatherbench.ipynb\">\n        <img src = \"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt = \"Colab\"></th>\n    <th><a href=\"https://kaggle.com/kernels/welcome?src=https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/mooc-machine-learning-weather-climate/blob/main/tier_1/weatherbench.ipynb\">\n        <img src = \"https://kaggle.com/static/images/open-in-kaggle.svg\" alt = \"Kaggle\"></th>\n  </tr>\n</table>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that to use Kaggle, you need to enable an option on the notebook.
